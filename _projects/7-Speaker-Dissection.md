This project is for MAE 3230, Fluid Mechanics.  It involves dissecting a box speaker, modeling it in CAD, and producing 
a 5 minute youtube video that describes the fluid mechanics of the speaker.  

Renderings of the speaker CAD are shown below, some with external bodies hidden to show internal components.
